## Installation

Sanaa is a single Go binary. All you need to do is download the binary [from the
releases page][releases] to any location in your `$PATH` and you're good to go.

If using Docker, there's the `kingori/sanaa` [image on Docker Hub][dockerhub].
For examples and more information, checkout out [the docker image's
repository][dockerrepo].

## Dependencies

Just make sure that `wkhtmltoimage` and `wkhtmltopdf`  are available in your
`$PATH` for sanaa to be able to autodetect them.

## Usage

### Getting Started

Start the server (that will receive requests):

```console
$ sanaa server --verbose
INFO[0000] Starting the server
INFO[0000] Request TTL set to 86400 seconds
INFO[0000] Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Start the worker (that will process requests):

```console
$ sanaa worker --s3-bucket=example-bucket-name --verbose
INFO[0000] Starting the worker
INFO[0000] Using wkhtmltoimage 0.12.4 (with patched qt)
INFO[0001] Using wkhtmltopdf 0.12.4 (with patched qt)

INFO[0001] Registering 'convert' queue
INFO[0001] Waiting to pick up jobs placed on any registered queue
```

### Rendering Images

```http
POST /render/image HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080

{
    "target": {
        "format": "png",
        "height": 480,
        "weight": 640
    },
    "source": {
        "url": "https://google.com"
    }
}
```

### Rendering PDFs

        "margin_top": 10,
        "margin_bottom": 10,
        "margin_left": 10,
        "margin_right": 10,

        "url": "https://google.com"
    }
}
```


## Development

Below instructions are only necessary if you intend to work on the source code
(find [contributing guidelines][contributing] here). For normal usage the above
instructions should do.

### Building

1. Fetch the code with `go get github.com/itskingori/sanaa`.
1. Install the Go development tools via `make dependencies`.
1. Install application dependencies via `make install` (they'll be placed in
   `./vendor`). Requires [Glide package manager][glide].
1. Build and install the binary with `make build`.
1. Run the command e.g. `./sanaa help`.

### Testing

1. Install the Go testing tools via `make dependencies`.
1. Run linter using `make lint` and test using `make test`.

### Documentation

The home page is built using [Jekyll][jekyll] (a fun and easy to use static site
generator) and it is [hosted on GitHub Pages][github-page]. The code is in the
`docs/` folder if you want to have a peek.

### Releasing

1. Create a tag (`git tag`) and push the tags to remote (`git push --tags`).
2. CI pipeline will detect the tag and create a [GitHub release here][releases].
   To note:
   * Tags matching `x.y.z` will be marked as final releases.
   * Tags matching `x.y.z-*` will be marked as pre-releases.
   * Tags not matching either of the above, will be ignored and assumed to be
     normal tags.
   * Compressed binary with a shasum 256 file will be uploaded as attachments to
     the release.

## Installation

Sanaa is a single Go binary. All you need to do is download the binary for your
platform [from the releases page][releases] to any location in your `$PATH` and
you're good to go.

If using Docker, there's the `kingori/sanaa` [image on Docker Hub][dockerhub].
For examples and more information, checkout out [the docker image's
repository][dockerrepo].

## Dependencies

Just make sure that `wkhtmltoimage` and `wkhtmltopdf`  are available in your
`$PATH` for sanaa to be able to autodetect them. Get [downloads
here][wkhtmltopdf].

## Usage

### Getting Started

Start the server (that will receive requests):

```console
$ sanaa server --verbose
INFO[0000] Starting the server
INFO[0000] Request TTL set to 86400 seconds
INFO[0000] Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Start the worker (that will process requests):

```console
$ sanaa worker --s3-bucket=example-bucket-name --verbose
INFO[0000] Starting the worker
INFO[0000] Using wkhtmltoimage 0.12.4 (with patched qt)
INFO[0001] Using wkhtmltopdf 0.12.4 (with patched qt)
INFO[0001] Concurrency set to 2
INFO[0001] Registering 'convert' queue
INFO[0001] Waiting to pick up jobs placed on any registered queue
```

### Basic Usage

#### Rendering Images & PDFs

For images, make a `POST` request to `/render/image`:

```http
POST /render/image HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
Connection: close
Content-Length: 172

{
    "target": {
        "format": "png",
        "height": 1080,
        "width": 1920
    },
    "source": {
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"
    }
}
```

For PDFs, make a `POST` request to `/render/pdf`:

```http
POST /render/pdf HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
Connection: close
Content-Length: 127

{
    "target": {
        "page_size": "A4"
    },
    "source": {
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"
    }
}
```

If a render request was successful, expect a `201 Created` HTTP response
indicating that the server has acknowledged the request:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 06 Feb 2018 05:19:09 GMT
Content-Length: 176
Connection: close

{
  "uuid": "640882bd-9441-48fb-8686-27286f399004",
  "created_at": "2018-02-06T05:19:09Z",
  "started_at": "",
  "ended_at": "",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "file_url": "",
  "status": "pending",
  "logs": ""
}
```

In case of failure, expect an appropriate response as well. For example:

1. `400 Bad Request` - unable to unmarshall the request JSON, or you've
   requested for a render type apart from the supported types i.e. `image` or
   `pdf`.
2. `500 Internal Server Error` - unable to enqueue the job for the workers to
   pick up e.g. if redis is down.

For each case, the body of the response should include a message explaining the
reason for failure. For example, if you send a bad JSON body during an image
render request, the response would be something like this:

```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 06 Feb 2018 07:26:44 GMT
Content-Length: 91
Connection: close

{
  "uuid": "536d3847-64b8-497a-8d8a-ac541dfa9c9e",
  "message": "Unable to unmarshal json to image type"
}
```


## Development

Below instructions are only necessary if you intend to work on the source code
(find [contributing guidelines][contributing] here). For normal usage the above
instructions should do.

### Building

1. Fetch the code with `go get github.com/itskingori/sanaa`.
1. Install the Go development tools via `make dependencies`.
1. Install application dependencies via `make install` (they'll be placed in
   `./vendor`). Requires [Glide package manager][glide].
1. Build and install the binary with `make build`.
1. Run the command e.g. `./sanaa help`.

### Testing

1. Install the Go testing tools via `make dependencies`.
1. Run linter using `make lint` and test using `make test`.

### Documentation

The home page is built using [Jekyll][jekyll] (a fun and easy to use static site
generator) and it is [hosted on GitHub Pages][github-page]. The code is in the
`docs/` folder if you want to have a peek.

### Releasing

1. Create a tag (`git tag`) and push the tags to remote (`git push --tags`).
2. CI pipeline will detect the tag and create a [GitHub release here][releases].
   To note:
   * Tags matching `x.y.z` will be marked as final releases.
   * Tags matching `x.y.z-*` will be marked as pre-releases.
   * Tags not matching either of the above, will be ignored and assumed to be
     normal tags.
   * Compressed binary with a shasum 256 file will be uploaded as attachments to
     the release.
